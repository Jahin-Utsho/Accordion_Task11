              JavaScript is used for creating interactive and dynamic content on
              websites, such as animations, form validations, and responsive
              user interfaces.

              A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope's
              variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.

              let has block scope, meaning it's limited to the block in which
              it's defined. var has function scope, which can lead to
              scope-related bugs.

              async and await are used to handle asynchronous operations more
              easily, allowing code to be written in a synchronous style for
              readability.

              Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions using the =>
              syntax, and they do not have their own this context, inheriting it
              from the surrounding scope.
